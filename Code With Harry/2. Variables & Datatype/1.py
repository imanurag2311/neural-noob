   RULES FOR CHOOSING AN IDENTIFIER
        1. A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores.
        2. A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscores.
        3. A variable name canâ€™t start with a digit.
        4. No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
